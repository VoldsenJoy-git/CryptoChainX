![Ether](https://i.ibb.co/DVF4tNW/image.png)
This project demonstrates how to build a modern Web 3.0 blockchain-based application using React, Solidity, and Ethereum. Key features include:

Smart Contract Integration: Written in Solidity, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum Wallet Support: Connect wallets like MetaMask to send and receive cryptocurrency.

Decentralized Application (dApp): Allows secure transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

Responsive UI: Built with modern UI/UX design using React.


CryptoChainX.

This name reflects the project's core focus on cryptocurrency transactions (Crypto), blockchain technology (Chain), and exchange or dApp functionality (X for exchange or app integration). It sounds modern and aligns well with the decentralized nature of your web3 and blockchain-based application.
